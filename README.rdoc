Room Reservation

Room Reservation is a project that has as its main goal to provide students and staff members of UC Berkeley with a convenient way to obtain information on rooms across campus to be reserved. We will be focused on creating a very user-friendly website, displaying an interactive map of campus which highlights all the buildings that are part of this project.
 	
In our website, we will be displaying the features of all the rooms, and search filters will also be available based on those aspects:
* Available time
* Capacity
* Location
* Technologies (projector, television, computer, speakers).
* Operating hours

Future goals are integrating Calnet Authentication and efficient communication across these buildings in order to make booking available directly through the website.
